# Maintenance

## Development

Changes target `dev`. Keep fixes and features in separate commits, with tests for
changed behavior. Merge `dev` into `main` with **Create a merge commit** for a
stable release.

## Verification

Run from the repository root:

```powershell
./scripts/check-source.ps1
./scripts/build.ps1
./scripts/test.ps1
npm.cmd test
```

Bytecode changes also require a full APK rebuild, original-aware DEX verification
and device testing. Record supported app versions and results in
`config/compatibility.json`.

## Twitch version updates

`scripts/evaluate-update.ps1` verifies an original APK or complete split bundle,
records its identity and optionally decompiles or patches it. For example:

```powershell
./scripts/evaluate-update.ps1 -InputApk '.local/inputs/twitch.apkm' -ExpectedVersion '31.5.2' -Decompile
```

Review the candidate's hooks before updating `TwitchTarget.kt`. Evaluate native
and React Native playback, chat, settings and ad handling before declaring a
version supported. Originals, signing keys and run artifacts stay under `.local/`.

See [the upgrade workflow](UPGRADES.md) for repository synchronization, baseline
checkpoints, device recovery and overnight acceptance checks.

## Releases

The workflow uses semantic-release. With `PATCH_RELEASES_ENABLED=true`, pushes to
`dev` publish prereleases and merges into `main` publish stable releases.

| Commit type | Version change |
| --- | --- |
| `fix:`, `perf:`, `bump:` | Patch |
| `feat:` | Minor |
| `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer | Major |
| `docs:`, `chore:` | None |

The highest version increment among the included commits wins. Commit subjects
form the release notes. The workflow generates `CHANGELOG.md`, patch metadata and
`.mpp` assets; public releases also receive build attestations. Builds and tests
run before publication. Release runs share a queue across `dev` and `main`.

The automatic run starts after a push or merge. Use **Run workflow** to retry a
failed run or release changes already on the branch. A second run checks for
unreleased commits before publishing.

Existing release notes can be edited in GitHub. Keep the corresponding historical
`CHANGELOG.md` entry in sync and retain the release tag and asset version.
